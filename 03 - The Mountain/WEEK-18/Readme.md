# Project : Stop Watch
In this first project, we will create a small app of a stopwatch.

The stopwatch should display the minutes, seconds and centiseconds.
We must have a START, a PAUSE, a RESET and a LAP buttons.
START starts the counter, that refreshes every centisecond. (10 times a millisecond). (Once it's started, the text should be RESUME and can't be clicked)
PAUSE stops the counter without reseting it. RESUME should be able to resume it.
RESET resets the counter to 0.
LAP displays the exact time when we clicked (the counter continues without stoping)

In this project, you will be led to master :
- useEffect
- useState
- Being able to set the state from previous state
- Establish logic with setTimeout, etc.

# Project : Markdown reader
In this project, we will have a textarea input where we can write markdown and next to it see the result in html.

Bonus : Create some buttons heading 1, heading 2, bold, italic, horizontal line, etc. to insert automatically the markdown syntax in the textarea to facilitate de writing of the markdown.

In this project, you will be led to master :
- the librarie marked
- the insertion of html in a react component (dangerouslySetInnerHtml)
