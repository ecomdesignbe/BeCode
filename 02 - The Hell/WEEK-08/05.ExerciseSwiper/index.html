                        <p>Tweety Bird is an Iconic cartoon character. He, like Bugs Bunny, puts a spin on nature, as his main enemy is Sylvester, a cat. Despite that, he defeats the cat every time. His wings, agility, and most of all his cleverness, saves him from being catfood every time. The pairing of Sylvester and Tweety was one of the most notable pairings. Most of the cartoons followed a standard formula:
                            The hungry "putty tat" wanting to eat the bird, some major obstacle stands in his way-usually Granny or her bulldog Hector
                            Tweety says "I tawt I taw a putty tat!" and "I did, I did taw a putty tat!"
                            Sylvester spends the entire time progressively more elaborate schemes or devices to capture his meal and failing.
