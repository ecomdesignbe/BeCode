const mainHeading = document.getElementById("main-heading");
// Now, mainHeading is an object that represents the h1 with id "main-heading"

mainHeading.style.color = "red";
// Inside the object mainHeading, we call the property "style" (wich is an object as well) and then the property color inside of style. We then assign "red" as a value to the color.
