/* Practice-04b

Given the existing code at the end, can you write some code so that their values are switched around?

var a = "3"; var b = "8";

The variable a shoudl hold the value "8".

And the variable b should hold the value "3".

When the code is run, it should output:

a is 8

b is 3

Copy the bellow code into your javascript file and tun it in the browser.

Do NOT change any of the existing code.

You are NOT allowed to type any numbers.

*/

var a = "3";
var b = "8";

/***********Do not change the code above ðŸ‘†*******/
//Write your code here :

var c = a;
var a = b;
var b = c;

/***********Do not change the code below ðŸ‘‡*******/

console.log("a is " + a);
console.log("b is " + b);

/* Practice-06b

Let's get some practice working with string methods.

Copy the below code to your javascript file.

Without altering the original value stored in message, please define a variable called whisper that is a lowercased version of message, with all the extra space at the beginning and end removed. 
You will need to use two string methods that we just covered.

Bonus: Make it in one line !

Copy this code :

*/

// DON'T TOUCH THIS LINE!
const message = "    TASTE THE RAINBOW!  "; //DON'T CHANGE THIS LINE PLEASE!

// YOUR CODE BELOW THIS LINE:

let whisper = console.log(message.toLowerCase().trim());

/* Another one :

Write a code that log to the console the last character of a string. For example : Dumbledore. But Don't count the quantity of character. 
You should write a code that could take any word and return the last character.

*/
let any_word = "Dumbledore";
let last_character = console.log(any_word.slice(any_word.lastIndexOf()));

/*
Tip :

Play with index selection and length
I've provided you with a word variable, set to "skateboard". Your goal is to use string methods on word, so that you end up with the string beard.

Use a string method to extract the "board" part of "skateboard" (using the slice method)

Replace the "o" in board with an "e" (using the replace method)

Save the result in a variable called facialHair and then log it in the console.

*/

// DON'T TOUCH THIS LINE! (please)
const word = "skateboard"; //Don't change this line!

// YOUR CODE BELOW THIS LINE:

let facialHair = console.log(word.slice(5).replace("o","e"));

VAT
Write an algorithm which receives a price without VAT and returns the price with VAT with a rate of 21%.

Make a Calculator! using prompt(), and variables, make a program that does the following:

Prompts the user for first number.
Stores that first number
Prompts the user for the second number.
stores that number and responds with the SUM by using an alert.
BONUS: Make a program that can subtract, multiply, and also divide!

Ok... Let's practice !

You will write a little program that, when the user enters the browser, it prompts some questions about the user.
name
which do you prefer, cats or dogs ?

Then, the browser should greet the user and make a comment about cats if he prefers cats or dogs if he prefers dogs.


let name = prompt("Quel est votre nom ?");
let cats = 'chat';
let dogs = 'chien';
let preference = prompt("Quel est votre animal prÃ©fÃ©rÃ© : chat ou chien");

What fruit?

Ask the user what is his favorite fruit.
If it's bananas, tell him you like bananas as well.
If it's strawberry, tell him you LOVE strawberries.
If it's grape, aks him if he prefers purple or green grapes.
    If it's purple, tell him you don't like purple grapes.
    If it's green, tell him green grapes are ok...
    If it's not purple or green, tell him you don't understand.
If it's another thing, tell him you don't understand the word he said (displaying the word he said).

Your task to is to create a variable named fullAddress that points to a string using the information from restaurant.

fullAddress should point to a string that includes the address, city, state, and zipcode from the restaurant object. 
Make sure to add any necessary commas or spaces between the values as seen in the exact expected output format shown below.

To make it harder to "cheat" by copy and pasting, I've randomly generated the address portion.

For example, if address was "64 Johnson Ave", the fullAddress variable would look like this:
"64 Johnson Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11206" // this is the expected output format of the fullAddress string (keep an eye on the commas and/or spaces between the values and match that too!)

Finally, log to the console the value of fullAdress

Let's make a todo list that works only in the terminal with what we've learned so far.

Instructions :

When the user enters the page, tha machine should ask him to write down a command :

new to add a todo
list to see all the todos
delete to remove a specific todo
quit to exit de program
Use the prompt() function to ask what they want to perform.

If the user choses new, prompt again to write what is the todo. When added, log to the console that the todo was added to the list.

If the user choses list, log to the console all the todos he has inserted. It should look like this :

********* TODO LIST *********
1. Walk out the dog
2. Drink some milk
3. Learn JavaScript
4. Make exercises
etc...
If the user choses delete, prompt what is the number of the todo and delete the todo

If the user choses quit, break the loop.

The user should be able to add as many todos he wants and , each time he choses list, be, able to see all of them.

TIPS :

Use an array to store the todos and to log them to the console when we ask to list
Keep in mind that the listing of the todos should begin with 1 (after all, we are not machines that start with 0)
The whole app should live inside a loop that only breaks when we choose "quit".
Use methods like splice()
Use the concept of falsy values


let input = prompt("Que voulez vous faire ? quit / new / list / delete");

let todos = [];

while (input !== "quit") {
    if(input === "new") {
        console.clear();
        let newTodo = prompt("Inserer un todo");
        todos.push(newTodo);
        input = prompt(`${newTodo} a Ã©tÃ© ajoutÃ©. Que voulez vous faire ?`);
    } else if (input === "list") {
        console.clear();
        console.log("*************** TODOS ***************");

        for(let i = 0;  i < todos.length; i++) {
            console.log(`${i + 1} - ${todos[i]}`);
        }
        input = prompt("Que voulez vous faire ?");
    } else if (input === "delete") {
        let deleteTodoindex = parseInt(prompt("Quel todos voulez vous supprimer ? le chiffre est acceptÃ©"));

        if (!deleteTodoindex) {
            deleteTodoindex = parseInt(prompt("Veuillez entrer un nombre valide"));
        } else {
            if(todos[deleteTodoindex - 1]) {
                console.log("ce todo n'existe pas");
            }
            else {
                `${todos[deleteTodoindex - 1]} est supprimÃ©`;
            }
            todos.splice(deleteTodoindex - 1, 1);
        }

    } else {
        input = prompt("Commande pas valide");
    }
}



Ok, so let's write our fist function !

This is a two step process : we define the function then we run (call) the function.

Once it's been declared, we can call a functions a thousand times if we want.

Declare a function that logs to the console :
console.log("DO");
console.log("RE");
console.log("MI");
console.log("FA");
console.log("SOL");
console.log("LA");
console.log("SI");
Does something happens in your console ? No ! We have to call it !

After the declaration of the function, call it myFunctionName()

Now you should see in the console the result of your function.

Now, call the function many times.

Each time you call it, it will repeat the console.log

function myFunctionName() {
    console.log("DO");
    console.log("RE");
    console.log("MI");
    console.log("FA");
    console.log("SOL");
    console.log("LA");
    console.log("SI");
}

myFunctionName();
myFunctionName();
myFunctionName();



Exercise on functions
Let's write function that throws as many dice we want with as many faces we want.

Write a function that takes two parameters faces and times

Inside of it, log to the console times times a die with faces faces.

Console log : die 1 : result, die 2 : result for each die.

Expected result for, for example, (6, 5) (the numbers should be random of course)

"Die 1: 4"
"Die 2: 1"
"Die 3: 1"
"Die 4: 6"
"Die 5: 3"

*/

function rollDice(faces, times) {
    console.log(`Die ${times} : ${faces}`);
}
